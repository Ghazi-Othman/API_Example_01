# API Example

Hello Coders . <br>
This is my very simple flutter app that dealing with api . <br>
I used [this website](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ) which give me a fake api . <br>
The API return json file which I converted to model and then show the info I want in the UI .<br>
I did not use state mangement , just setState . <br>
Very simple UI because the goal of this app is to learn how to deal with API.<br>
